# From Rungs To Riches- College and Mobility
## Objective of Project
Social mobility is the ability to move up the social ladder from a low socio-economic status (SES) to a higher socio-economic status. It has been observed that it has been declining in the United States in the last few decades. Studies show that each consecutive generation's likelihood of earning more than their parents and moving into a higher social class is decreasing. This trend raises critical questions about how to improve the situation and make social mobility more feasible, especially for individuals from lower social backgrounds. This was the project's motivation, and to analyze that, we picked the roles that colleges play in helping children of low SES parents reach higher SES groups. Below are the key questions the project tries to address.
•What is the relationship between college education and intergenerational mobility?
To answer this broad question and to understand whether the region or a specific tier of college aids intergenerational mobility, we are trying to answer the questions below.
•How does college admission affect lower socio-economic backgrounds?
•Does the region of the college play a role in the relationship?
•How does the tier of colleges have an impact on the relationship?

## Data Description
The data was sourced from Opportunity Insights contributed by the paper, “Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility Across Colleges in the United States.” The data consists of parent’s and children’s income distributions by college, separately by birth cohort. The important variables and their descriptions are below,
### Categorical Variables
1.	Region: 4 different regions in the US 
2.	Tier of the Colleges
3.	Cohort: 1980-91
### Numerical variables
1.	Fraction of parents in a specific income quintile (1-5)
- Fraction of parents in an income quintile. 1 is the bottom quintile and 5 is the top.
2.	Fraction of children in a specific income quintile (1-5)
- Fraction of parents in the top percentile. For instance, par_toppt1pc refers to parents in the top 0.1% of the income distribution.
3.	Mobility Rate
- Mobility rate of a college is calculated by calculating the joint probability of parents in the bottom range and children in the top range of the income distribution

## Conclusion
The tier of college and region of colleges play important role in how college affects intergenerational social mobility. The type of college can influence the mobility rate of children from low socio-economic backgrounds, with Ivy League and other elite schools having similar mobility rates despite having lower enrollment. The region of the college also plays a role, with the northeast region having a higher mean or average mobility rate compared to the south, west, and Midwest regions. The tier of the college can also impact the relationship, with selective public and private colleges contributing more to the enrollment of children from low socio-economic backgrounds than Ivy League and other elite schools.
